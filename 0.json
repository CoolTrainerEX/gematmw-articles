    "content": "Mathematics can be found in various fields, including visual arts. According to the Oxford Dictionary, visual arts can be defined as “creative art whose products are to be appreciated by sight, such as painting, sculpture, and film.” On the surface, visual arts and mathematics might have nothing in common. However, visual arts is not just about painting or creating sculptures; it often involves a deep understanding of mathematical concepts such as the golden ratio, fractals, and geometric transformations. Artists often use these concepts to create balance and harmony in their works. This shows that mathematics is not only about equations or formulas, but it is also a source of inspiration for artists.<br>The golden ratio, denoted as \\phi; (phi), is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 1.618. It is closely linked to the Fibonacci Sequence. Furthermore, it is also believed that the golden ratio is the most pleasing proportion to the eye, as demonstrated in many classical paintings. One of the most famous paintings exemplifying the golden ratio is The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci."
