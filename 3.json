    "content": "<p>Mathematics includes more than just simple mathematical formulas or math problems in textbooks. In fact, mathematics has always been ubiquitous in life. Mathematics covers many fields, such as architecture. Architecture, art and technique of designing and building. The practice of architecture is employed to fulfill both practical and expressive requirements, and thus it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic ends (Collins et al., 2000). Architecture is closely related to mathematics. Sketching and designing buildings require the application of certain knowledge of mathematics. Mathematical knowledge often used in architecture includes the Fibonacci sequence, golden ratio, and fractals.</p><p>According to Brasil (2024), the Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous sequences in history, published in the Book of Calculations by Leonardo of Pisa in 1202. This famous sequence of numbers has been called \"nature's code.\" The Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the golden ratio. The golden ratio means that the ratio between two numbers is about 1.618, and in the Fibonacci sequence, if you divide the number pairs in the sequence (the larger number divided by the smaller number), you will get about 1.618 numerical value. Many buildings use the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, such as the Parthenon and the Taj Mahal.</p><figure><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=12H4AQv653D_b4uKqe59GghY0RxSKRbUR&sz=w1024\"><figcaption>Source: Brasil (2024)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=12JIYbAE7FtsRXm0pcCPjR8Myu198uQaa&sz=w1024\"><figcaption>Source: Meisner (2014)</figcaption></figure><p>A fractal is a never-ending pattern.
