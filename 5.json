    "content": "From ancient architectural wonders to modern digital worlds, the beauty of mathematics lives on. In humanity's expressions of faith and love, despair and loss, mathematics remains a constant. In the past, we use mathematical patterns to build grand monuments and paint lustrous images, allowing for further discovery and societal progression. We continue this tradition up to the contemporary age, especially with the rise of AI technologies. At its core, machine learning requires deep pattern recognition to do its job, algorithms that have been derived from the great mathematical solutions of the past and present. Be it not for the initial recognition of mathematical precision in nature, we would not have been able to develop such immense technology today. We thank our ancestors in understanding the beauty of the math in the world around them, and, as part of the same human species, we hope to follow in their footsteps, so that onne day, our descendants may do the same."
